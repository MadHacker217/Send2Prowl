==========

This extension lives in your tool bar and tools menu, when clicked simply pushes the current webpage to your iPhone/iPad via Prowl. Similar to the Chrome-to-Android Service. I made this extension because there wasn't one avaliable for Firefox, and I wanted one. Completely free and open source, use for whatever you like -- go ahead and steal it. You can view more information on Prowl's website: [http://www.prowlapp.com/apps.php](http://www.prowlapp.com/apps.php)
