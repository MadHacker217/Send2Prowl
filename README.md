I developed this addon in college. It once had 1000s of users all over the world. Since then, apps like Pocket and Instapaper have grown, and as such the usefulness of this extention has shrunk. I've also graduated college, and am dedicating all my waking hours to my work. [TimeToFixStuff](https://github.com/TimeToFixStuff) has now taken on development.
